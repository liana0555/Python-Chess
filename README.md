Our project for our final project on Python programming. 
## Team:

## Game Objective:
Checkmate is a position in which the opponent's king is under attack and cannot avoid capture. The game ends with the victory of the player who checkmated. In case of a draw there is no win.
## How figures move: 
*King: moves one square in any direction. Cannot remain under check.
*Queen: moves any number of squares horizontally, vertically or diagonally. 
*Rook: moves any number of squares vertically or horizontally. 
*Bishop: moves any number of squares diagonally. 
*Knight: walks in the letter "G" (two squares in one direction and one perpendicular). Can jump over pieces. 
*Pawn: moves one square forward (can move two squares from the initial position). Strikes diagonally.
