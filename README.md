# Python-Chess

Our project for our final project on Python programming.

## Team:

Danylo Bazalinskyi, Mikhailova Liana

## Game Objective:

Checkmate is a position in which the opponent's king is under attack and cannot avoid capture. The game ends with the victory of the player who checkmated. In case of a draw there is no win.

## How figures move:

\*King: moves one square in any direction. Cannot remain under check.

\*Queen: moves any number of squares horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

\*Rook: moves any number of squares vertically or horizontally.

\*Bishop: moves any number of squares diagonally.

\*Knight: walks in the letter "G" (two squares in one direction and one perpendicular). Can jump over pieces.

\*Pawn: moves one square forward (can move two squares from the initial position). Strikes diagonally.

## Puzzles:
You have already placed pieces and you have to checkmate your opponent as quickly and favorably as possible. At the same time the opponent (black pieces), must hold out as long as possible and not lose. 
With each level / with each subsequent puzzle, it will be more and more difficult to checkmate. So you need to be patient and knowledgeable. 

## Features:
\*U - undo past move

\*Up and down arrow - flip through the history of moves 

\*ESC - return to the main menu / quit the game (if in the main menu).
